# Fall 2025

* Due to course size and popularity, groups are required to be teams of 4.
* To minimize the amount of instruction time lost, Exams are being reduced to 25 minutes from 50 minutes. They are still happening during class (including the fifth exam, which was historically given during the final exam period).
* A comprehensive final is available during the final exam period for students interested in improving their grade. It will cover parts of all of the separate modules, and will be averaged into your final grade.
* The course now has an explicit **Generative AI philosophy**:
  * Generative AI use is **strongly discouraged** for homework assignments. *We will not perform any check to see whether you have done so or not*. The grading for these assignments is lenient - the expected median grade for the class is 100%.
  * A substantial portion of the module exam will cover topics that are tightly tied to the module's homework assignment. **Working your way through the homeworks without the help of Generative AI is the best way to succeed at these questions**.
  * Generative AI is not allowed on in class assessments.
  * Generative AI use is *encouraged* for the final project, studying for in-class quizzes, and studying for in-class exams.
* Added more new original readings.

# Fall 2024

* Switched module exams to during class rather than after class, with a 25 minute review session preceding each exam.
* The course largely uses readings that Professor Kanich wrote instead of random blog posts and other online resources.
* Generative AI is explicitly allowed for all out of class work, but is (obviously) not allowed during in class assessments.
* After setting the letter grade cutoffs and dropping the lowest exam as per the syllabus, all students must have an exam average that is greater than or equal to the overall grade cutoff for passing (D or better) to pass the course.

# Fall 2023

* Switched from one midterm + one final to five 50-minute module exams in the evenings
