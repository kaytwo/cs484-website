# Homework F.1 - final project tech stack and MVP proposal

By 11:59 PM on Monday, November 7th you must:

- Set up CI to host the built version of your team GH repository
  - Include a link to your deployed app in `README.md` so that I can take a look
- Include a diagram (in text or drawn or however you please) of your tech stack:
  - What services you will use to host (front end, back end, database)
  - What technologies you will use on the front end and back end
  - What APIs you will call out to
- Include a short textual description of what MVP (minimum viable product) you will be aiming to complete by the end of week 13.

**IF** You want to use Netlify to host your site, their new free tier rules don't allow private organization repositories (which your team final project GH repository is). Your options are:

1. Don't use netlify - [vercel](https://vercel.com) and [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) will allow you to use private organization repos.
2. Make your `ckclassrooms/final-project-proposal-TEAMNAME` repository public. This will allow you to host on Netlify.
3. Make a new (private) repository within one of your team members' GitHub accounts, and share it with [me](https://github.com/kaytwo). Also, you must include a link to this new repository in your team's `final-project-proposal` repository `README.md` so that I know where to find it when grading.

This is worth zero points, but it's still important for you to hit these deadlines to keep moving forward toward your final project.
