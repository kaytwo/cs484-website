import { localizeTime, formatTime, calculateAbsoluteDate } from "../../../utils/dateUtils";
import { Content as Deadlines } from "../../../components/Deadlines.md";
import DueDate from "../../../components/DueDate.astro";
import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { marked } from "marked";

**Release:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_release}  />

**Due:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />

## Quickstart

Create a new **private** repository under your own GitHub account
from [this template](https://github.com/swad-cs-uic/homework5-f24).

## Installing required packages

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the
dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Skeleton code

The homework provided is focused on optimizing React applications using various
performance-enhancing techniques. You will work through four problems, each located in the `/src/components` folder.

- Prevent UI blocking with Web Workers
- Memoize expensive calculation results with useMemo
- Optimize event handlers with useCallback and memo
- Virtualize long lists with react-window

## Running the application

To run the application, type `npm run dev` in the terminal. This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Deliverables

Your submission should properly implement optimization techniques according to the
instructions for each of the problems.

## Testing

To test your implementation, run `npm run test`.

## Points Breakdown

| Problem             | Points |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Web Workers         | 25     |
| useMemo             | 25     |
| useCallback         | 25     |
| List Virtualization | 25     |

## Due Date

This homework is due on <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />.
