This is the first checkpoint for your final project. The most important things you must do before turning it in are:

* Find a group to work with
* Come up with a basic project idea
* Create a GitHub repository for your project and share it with your team and the course staff

## Project requirements

The requirements for the project idea are:

### It must not be a CRUD app

CRUD stands for create, retrieve, update, delete (common database operations). A
CRUD app is typically an application that builds a user interface around those
database operations (and not much else). As I mentioned in class - CRUD apps
make the world go round, there are literally millions of them.

### It must not be a carbon copy of something that already exists

A large part of our goal for this course is to (a) motivate you to create
something unique that you can show off during job interviews, and (b) give you
the chance to design the architecture and implementation for the app from the
ground up. Thus, while it can be very useful to re-implement an app idea that
already exists, in this case you need to come up with something new. It doesn't
have to be the most unique thing ever, but it has to be non-trivially different
than other things that alrady exists.

This requirement, like many others, is a great reason to get started early on
your project idea. I am super excited to help students brainstorm project ideas,
whether it's at office hours, on Piazza, or quickly after class. The more time
you spend on this now, the higher likelihood that you come up with something
fun, and the higher likelihood that you actually are motivated to work on
finishing the project later on in the semester when things are getting busy.

## Project inspiration

If you're having trouble coming up with a project idea, here are some things
that have worked in the past / that I would expect to be good project ideas
that aren't TOO hard but will end up being impressive if you do them correctly:

* Something to do with UIC **specifically** - helping students choose classes,
  get around campus, or things like that. Note that this is UIC _specifically_ -
  if the implementation is generic and would be just as relevant at another
  school, not as interesting.
* Something that uses Large Language Models - there are a lot of very cheap APIs
  you can use online to summarize text, provide natural language suggestions, or
  many other options. There's no requirement that you use paid APIs in your
  project, but there's no requirement that you don't either.
* Something that uses in-person interactions - there are a lot of cool things you
  can do with QR codes, NFC, or other in-person interaction methods that can be
  really fun to implement and use. I have a handful of writable NFC tags that I
  would be happy to give you a few of if you get started on a project that could
  make use of them.
* Something that uses a lot of data - if you're interested in data science or AI
  or just want to learn more about how to work with data, there are a lot of
  public datasets available that you can use to build a cool project. You can
  also collect them "live" (for instance, using a feed of Bluesky posts), but be
  aware that sometimes that can take longer than you would expect to get right,
  and there are a lot of uncensored data feeds on the Internet.



## Deployment

For this checkpoint, you don't need to deploy anything, or even really think
hard about it. But you will EVENTUALLY need to deploy your app such that it is
available 24/7 when I am going to look at it to grade it (both the MVP that's
due earlier and the final project due at the end of the semester). It will need
to be available via HTTPS, and I will need to be able to use all of the app's
functionality.

My strong recommendation is to set up a deployment pipeline that deploys to
Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or other similar services that build your app from
GitHub and deploy it automatically. This will be the best way to get experience
with modern app deployment techniques, as well as just keep the app up and
running.

It is also acceptable to deploy your app on a VPS or other server that you
control, as long as incoming valid https connections can be made (you need to
configure this yourself). I would expect this to be helpful if you already have
a severver (perhaps with a nice GPU) that you would use for a self-hosted LLM
idea that could cost lots of money if you used an external service. **I
recommend not doing this unless you have a good reason to do so and are familiar
with self-hosting web services.** Please ask on Piazza if you have an
architecture or project idea and want to know the best way to try to deploy it
without spending much / any money on hosting/services.


### Deliverables

The two deliverables are your repository (it can be empty, but you can also get
started on it if you want), and submitting [This
form](https://forms.gle/hhP6cm4Zw2aup1J68). Remember that this assignment is not
worth any points, but if you don't get started finding a good project idea, I
will be grading your later checkpoints based on my personal opinion rather than
the expectations that we set together.

### What happens if you don't turn in the checkpoint?

This checkpoint is worth zero points, so not submitting it will not negatively
impact your grade. Groups are required to be 4 students. If you do not submit
the form with a group of four students, the course staff will allocate you to a
group with three other students who also didn't submit the form.

Nothing besides the MVP (due in week 12) and the final project (due at the end
of week 15) are graded for points. The things that you propose in each
checkpoint set expectations for what your group will do and how you'll do it. If
you don't set those expectations, I'll just grade everything based on what I
think a good project is expected to do - you could receive full points because
what you did was actually fine, or you could receive zero points because you're
implementing a CRUD app or what you chose isn't substantial enough or what you
chose is a carbon copy of something else that exists out in the world.
