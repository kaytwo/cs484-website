# {frontmatter.description}

We will be hacking the UIC [Juiceshop](https://juice-shop.cs.uic.edu:30443/balancer/). This is an intentionally vulnerable full stack web
application built with Angular, Express, and Sqlite.

When starting to use the juice shop, it will ask you for your team name. This is
an individual assignment. Use **your netID** (not your UIN, `ckanich` is a
netID) as your team name. Feel free to get started as soon as you find this
writeup online.

Once you're in the Juice Shop, there are hints about what you should do first.
Eventually, you will find a main map of how the entire intentionally vulnerable
application "game" works. The main task will be to find and exploit several
different flavors of vulnerability.

The juice shop keeps a [high score
board](https://juice-shop.cs.uic.edu:30443/balancer/score-board/). You receive nothing
but bragging rights for getting a high score.

## Find it fix it

In addition to exploiting vulnerabilities, a subset of all of the tasks have a
"find it + fix it" task, where you first select which lines are the problem, and
then choose from a set of multiple choice options for how to best fix that
problem. You get as many attempts as you want for these, and it will explain
what the right answer is for you.

These do not show up in the score board, but will be computed as part of your
score on the homework (see below).

## Academic integrity

There are two forms of documentation available for the juice shop - the hints
that are directly linked from the score board, and other materials available
online. Using the hints available through the juice shop is totally acceptable,
and the hints available on the main writeup on
[pwning.owasp-juice.shop](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/). However, to get the
most out of the assignment, give it a shot without reading through all of the
hints right away.

There are also various other writeups and videos online that walk you through
the entire task (including a solutions appendix on the official documentation
website). **Do NOT** use those. Juice Shop has several anti-cheat mechanisms
built into it that will make it easy to detect people who aren't attempting the
assignment in good faith. It's all open source so you're free to inspect the
anti-cheat mechanisms.

If we detect evidence of cheating, we reserve the right to ask you to perform
the tasks that you were able to successfully perform in your submission. This
assignment leans heavily on the honor system for getting the most out of it:
students who are found through the DoS process to have broken the academic
integrity policy on this assignment will fail the course. If you ONLY use Piazza
for Q&A and ONLY use the built-in hint system, you will be fine.

## Collaboration and Extra credit

This is an individual assignment, but helping each other is encouraged - my two
rules for helping are:

1. **Any** help that you provide to others must be posted as a public question
   on Piazza.
2. Any help on Piazza should not COMPLETELY give the answer away, but it is fine
   to come closer than the hints provided in the main writeup on
   [pwning.owasp-juice.shop](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/).

As I mentioned in the syllabus, **significant assistance for other students**
can be converted into extra credit on your final grade. There is no cutoff for
this (please don't ask what it is), but people who make a good faith effort will
generally be rewarded. Also, this only counts if I see it - so do this help on
Piazza (not Discord).

## Submitting your score

To submit your score, you will need to download your progress snapshot:

![screenshot of export setting button](/settings.png "Export settings")

![screenshot of export progress button](/export-progress.png "Export progress")

Then upload this file to gradescope.

Using someone else's (partial or full) progress snapshot is a violation of the
academic integrity policy. They are not tied to your identity, so the juice shop
won't prevent you from uploading someone else's progress file, but the
monitoring system can detect when you upload a progress snapshot that you did
not achieve yourself.

## Points

There are far more tasks in this juice shop than we would expect you to get done.
To get 100% for this assignment, youneed to finish 11 "find it fix it" tasks and
30 of the main puzzles. "find it fix it" tasks are worth twice as much as normal
puzzles. Beyond that, every additional "find it fix it" is a bonus 2%, and every
additional puzzle is a bonus 1%, up to a total bonus of 100% (which is equivalent
to wiping out a whole missed assignment).

Your full score can be computed as:

| Task                            | Points      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| first 11 "find it fix it" tasks | ~3.85% each |
| first 30 puzzles                | ~1.92% each |
| next 15 "find it fix it" tasks  | 2% each     |
| next 70 puzzles                 | 1% each     |

## Due date

This homework is due on <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />. This deadline is
FIRM. This assignment is easier than all of the rest, so please put some time in
and finish it before the deadline, so you have more time to work on your final
project.
