## {frontmatter.description}

**Quickstart**: Host the string "CS 484 Homework 0" and your uic email address
on the Internet someplace. Turn in a GitHub repository with that URL in a file
called `url.txt` via Gradescope.Watch [the kickoff
video](https://youtu.be/C81AdTlY6xw) or read below for more details.

**Release:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_release}  />

**Due:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />

By the end of this assignment you will have your own web app deployed on the web
for all to see. You can make this web app as simple or as complex as you want -
all it _needs_ to do is show your UIC email address and the text "CS 484
Homework 0" (case sensitive). The more important part is confirming that you can
use the course assignment submission system (Gradescope), and getting your tools
set up for _Continuous Integration_ and _Continuous Deployment_.

### Unix-based development environment required

One of the awesome things about web development is that on the server side and
the client side, it's pretty cross-platform. However, once you get into more
advanced topics, you'll find that the vast majority of web servers are running
Unix-based operating systems (mostly Linux), and many developers are using Macs
or Linux machines for local development.

If you're on a Mac or Linux, you're all set for the first couple assignments,
local development will work as expected. If you're on Windows, you have a few
options:
* You can use the [Windows Subsystem for
  Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) to create a Linux
  environment on your Windows machine. VSCode has some great tools for working
  with WSL, but they aren't required.
* You can use a virtual machine to run a full Linux distribution. This is a bit
  more heavyweight than WSL, but it's a good option if you want to get used to
  using Linux. If you're on a new ARM Windows laptop, this might not work as
  expected, and I can't provide support as I don't have one to test with.

One tricky part is that _most_ things will work on Windows, but many things will
start breaking in unexpected ways. So unless you're really intent on developing
in Windows, I'd suggest using one of the options above for working on your
assignments in this class (and other advanced CS classes).

## Requirements vs. Recommendations

The only _requirement_ for this assignment is to get your email address and the
string "CS 484 Homework 0" hosted on the Internet at a given URL. Once you've
done that, put the URL in the file `url.txt`, put that file in a github
repository, and submit it to Gradescope. That's it, that's the assignment.

However, I **recommend** that you configure a continuous development environment
to allow you to update that web application simply by pushing an update to
your GitHub repository. 

For some of you, this is something you've never done before and don't even know
where to get started. No worries! We'll walk you through it. For those that have
done this dozens of times before, perhaps take this as an opportunity to use a
different platform, language, or framework than you're used to using.

For the example I'll be doing in the kickoff video, I'll be using [Cloudflare
Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) to build and host the app, and
[Astro](https://astro.build/) as the framework. Feel free to experiment with
anything you'd like - there's a huge list of [services with free
tiers](https://free-for.dev/) for developers, including many for free web
hosting.

### Local development

Before getting started with this course, I assume you have some familiarity with:

* Using git
and GitHub to manage source code
* Using a code editor or IDE (VSCode (and derivatives like Cursor) is good, I'm
  currently using [Zed](https://zed.dev/))

#### Installing Node.js

We will be using Node.js to build and run JavaScript applications. The easiest
way to get started is to go to the [Node.js download
page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and download the LTS version of Node.js
for your laptop. This will allow you to use the `node` command to run JavaScript
programs from the command line, and use the node package manager `npm` to
download dependencies for your project, install additional packages, run package
scripts, and more.

### Creating and deploying a template repository

Cloudflare, like many other web services, offers a "CLI" (command line
interface) that allows developers to quickly and easily access their services.
Once you've got Node installed, you can run this single command and follow its
prompts to deploy an Astro-based web app on Cloudflare's network.

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-484-app --framework=astro
```

#### Running the template

Once the template has been created and published, you can open your new project
in your IDE and edit it as you please. You can run a *local development server* which
simulates how your web application will operate when it is hosted on the Internet by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run your app in a special mode where any updates to your source code
are immediately pushed to the browser via a special plugin that isn't included
in your code when you actually build it for production.

### Getting the most out of your IDE

Modern programming makes extensive use of strong typing - the ability to declare
(or infer) at build time what type any given symbol refers to. Importantly, this
allows your IDE to understand your code as you type, and give you suggestions
for which methods to call, what value an argument should take, or inform you
when you've used something incorrectly. VSCode and Zed both have "out of the box"
integration with TypeScript to validate your code as you type, and provide suggestions
based on the types of various symbols in your source code.

In addition to type checking, you should also configure your IDE to perform
format checking and lint checking as you type. This will help you avoid common
mistakes, and ensure that your code is formatted correctly according to the
standards we will be using in this class. This is all optional right now - we'll
go into more detail about these topics later in class.

For fresh JavaScript/TypeScript based projects, I recommend using
[biome.js](https://biomejs.dev/). [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for
formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting are also good options,
but biome.js does both, much faster, and with a much cleaner configuration.

#### What is Lint checking?

Linting checks for issues that will not necessarily cause your code to crash or
even run incorrectly, but nonetheless are very usually errors. Take for instance
the [no-dupe-else-if](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-dupe-else-if)
rule, which states that you can't use the same conditional more than once in the
same set of else-if statements. So while this code is correct JavaScript that
can execute:

```js
if (a) {
  foo();
} else if (b) {
  bar();
} else if (b) {
  baz();
}
```

The call to `baz()` will never happen, and it's very likely there's some
programmer error happening here. Linters are designed with [dozens of
rules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/javascript/rules/) that help find issues like these
for you.

### How to "fix" the code

You only need to change two files in the repository: you need to add `url.txt`
in the root of the repository to include your deployed web app's URL, and you
need to edit the code in whatever way makes your UIC email and "CS 484 Homework
0" show up on that URL. 

### How to look at your website

If you want to experiment with the Astro template, you can run `npm run dev` and
your email address should show up as soon as you save `src/pages/index.astro`.
As long as you've met the listed requirements, you can make your app look
as pretty or ugly or ridiculous as you want. Go nuts!

## Web App Deployment

So far, we've deployed the basic template, built and run our code locally, and
updated the local version to list our own email address. Now for the fun part -
deploying our web app. You must deploy your web app to the Internet for credit
on this assignment. Cloudflare is probably the easiest, but you can use Amazon,
Vercel, Netlify, GitHub pages, or any other service as long as the web app can
be deployed successfully and stays online (**we may re-run the autograder at any
time!**).

Once you've made an update to the source code, you can immediately update the
global deployment by running this command from the root of your project:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will build your app using Astro's build system, and then connect to
Cloudflare and upload all of the newly compiled code. After a few seconds, your
web app will be updated on the Internet.

### Continuous Deployment

While it's all well and good to manually run `npm run deploy` every time you
make a change, it's much better to have this happen automatically whenever you
push a change to your GitHub repository. This allows different people to work on
the same web app at the same time, allows you to perform more checks before
pushign to your *production* server, and makes the builds more reproducible by
always running the same build process on the same infrastructure.

For Cloudflare Workers, the easiest way to get Continuous Deployment working is
to log in to the web dashboard and connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare.
This will allow Cloudflare to automatically build and deploy your app whenever
you push a change to your repository. I go over this in the kickoff video.

## Submitting your work

After you are confident that your web app is running as expected, you can submit
it via Gradescope. **Check Piazza for the Gradescope invitation code**. All the
Gradescope autograder does is reads `url.txt`, grabs that URL, and checks for
your email address and the static string mentioned above. **Gradescope will only
allow GitHub based submissions** - you must add `url.txt` to your repository and
submit it through Gradescope. If you have issues with the autograder, please
contact us via Piazza ASAP.

## Points

This assignment is all-or-nothing: if you deploy a web app that has the right
text in it, you get full credit. If you don't, you don't. If you follow along
with either these instructions or the kickoff video, you should be able to
finish this assignment in less than 30 minutes, even if you've never used
JavaScript before. This is almost certainly the easiest assignment, so I
recommend you aim for full points.
