## {frontmatter.description}

**Due:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />

**Release:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_release}  />

TLDR: submit [this form](https://forms.gle/n9cdZMK8C24wprqC6) before the deadline.

For this deliverable, you're responsible for four core things:

* Provide a link to your **deployed** app where I can test the functionality.
* Provide a link to your source repository/repositories where I can see the code.
* Provide a description of what your **initial** plan was for the functionality of the app, and the **final** functionality of the app. If you realize any time before the deadline that one of your deliverables from checkpoint 1 is not going to be met, contact me ASAP and we can see if we can adjust the scope of the project.
* Provide any information about which special credentials needed for specific 3rd party API restrictions (i.e. needing to add my google or spotify account to a list of approved testers). This should just be a reminder - you need to reach out to me beforehand if this applies to your project.

# Your deliverable is a deployed website

Rather than testing code, we will be testing a deployed website for this deliverable. This means that while you can continue to work on your app after the deadline, **we can perform our testing at any time, and if your app is in a broken state in production when we test it, you will get the points that that version of the site earns**. In other words, if you wish to continue working on your app after the deadline, you ABSOLUTELY MUST work on new features on a branch besides the main deployed branch (or you can submit a "mvp" branch deploy), and if you do want to push "improvements" to the version that I grade, make darn sure that you've tested it thoroughly before doing so.
