# {frontmatter.description}

This assignment gets you hands-on with a minimal “cookie-cutter” web application. There is a basic React app on the front end. You
simply need to implement the absolute basics of adding and getting high scores
from the database.

## Project structure

### `db/schema.ts`

This defines the database schema to be used. We're using
drizzle to interact with the database. This allows us to switch out the
underlying database technology without changing the code much / at all. The
important things you'll need to be able to do are run the relevant queries
against the database: you can do this however you like, but I'd recommend using
either the [Drizzle style](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview#why-sql-like)
sql-like queries or Drizzle's [`sql` template string
creator](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql#sql-template), which is especially useful
if you already know SQL and just want to run queries against the database.

### `wrangler.jsonc`

This is the Cloudflare Workers config file that tells Wrangler how to run the app.
In this project it declares the worker entry (main), sets the compatibility_date,
and most importantly binds the D1 database via "d1_databases" so that the app is able to used
c.env.DB

### `drizzle/0000_wealthy_katie_power.sql`

The post installation script uses `0000_wealthy_katie_power.sql` to create the high score database
with the schema defined under schema.ts. Once, the table is created under `.wrangler/state` folder, then
drizzle is used to interact and update the values in the database. If you were to delete .wrangler folder
by mistake, you can run command " npx wrangler d1 migrations apply test-db --local " to have database
created again as described under wrangler.jsonc file

### `public/`

The public directory holds all of the static files that your web application
needs to serve without any processing. For our app, this includes images and CSS
files.

### `src/worker/index.ts`

These files are the main ones you need to understand, and for `worker/index.ts`, the one
that you will be editing to complete this assignment. This would contain the required functions
to interact with the database as the react app on the frontend. You need to make appropriate changes
to the Hono api functions so that you are able to achieve the following goals:

- Save High Score: It can be used to save the high score for the given session by clicking on it.
- Display High Score: When user comes in for first time , high score of 0 is shown. Once user saves high score and
  later returns to play around with the counter. Last saved High Score would be displayed under the Save High Score
  Button. If user scores more than the high score and saves the score, then that particular high score would be stored
  for the user.

## Checking your work

### Running testcases locally

`npm run test` will run the test suite locally. Remember, as with any other
assignments in class, you should double check that your tests are passing in the
gradescope environment in addition to your local environment. "It works on my
machine" does not count as a valid excuse for failing tests in the autograder.

### Non-adversarial tests

The tests in this assignment were written in a very straightforward way. They
are meant to look like the type of test you might write for your own code to
ensure that it works correctly, NOT a very high confidence test that you have
actually coded everything up such that it works properly. For instance, it would
be very easy to write code that passes the tests but does not provide a
functional CRUD app showing the high score from the database.

We reserve the right to investigate any submission to ensure that it is actually
showing the high score from the database rather than simply passing the tests by
injecting nonsense markup that passes the tests.

## Deploying your Application.

There are no points awarded for deploying your app to a live server, but it is a
good exercise to get familiar with the process. Hono can be deployed to Render
as a Node.js app - that is basically exactly what you've created here and the
most straightforward way to do so. However if you'd like some experience
deploying to a serverless provider, you can reconfigure [Hono to work on a
serverless app platform](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/web-standard) and
[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/tutorials) to use a serverless
database provider.

## Submitting your work

After you are confident that your code works, you can push the code to GitHub,
and then submit it via Gradescope. You can find the link to our class gradescope
in the sidebar. If you have issues with the autograder, please
contact us via Piazza ASAP. **Please keep in mind that technical issues while
submitting your assignment is not an acceptable excuse for improper or late
submissions.**
