# {frontmatter.description}


This assignment gives you experience building a basic router-based server-side
web application. There is no JavaScript functionality on the front end. You
simply need to implement the absolute basics of listing, adding and removing
items from a product database.

## Project structure

### `src/db.js` and `src/schema.js`

These files define the database schema and the database connection. We're using
drizzle to interact with the database. This allows us to switch out the
underlying database technology without changing the code much / at all. The
important things you'll need to be able to do are run the relevant queries
against the database: you can do this however you like, but I'd recommend using
either the [Drizzle style](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview#why-sql-like)
sql-like queries or Drizzle's  [`sql` template string
creator](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql#sql-template), which is especially useful
if you already know SQL and just want to run queries against the database.

### `src/seed.js` and `src/products.sql`

The seed script uses `products.sql` to populate the database with the known good
list of products. You can run this via `node src/seed.js` whenever you like and
it will reset the database to the known good state.

### `public/`

The public directory holds all of the static files that your web application
needs to serve without any processing. For our app, this includes images and CSS
files.

### `src/app.js` and `src/template.js`

These files are the main ones you need to understand, and for `app.js`, the one
that you will be editing to complete this assignment. `template.js` exports a
single function, `generateHTML`, which takes in various substrings and returns a
well-formatted page populated with all of the relevant information for every
_view_ that our application has. The views you need to create are:

* the main page: it should just list all of the products, 10 at a time, with a
  list of pages along the bottom.
* the search result page: it should list all of the products that match the
  given search. This can be implemented very similarly to the home page.

#### Additional routes

In addition to search results and the home page, the two other functionalities
that must be added are add and delete items. You should take a look at the
functionality in the forms on the main page to determine how those will be
invoked - you can even just load the empty main page and look at what requests
are being sent using the network tab in your browser's developer tools.

You are free to implement these routes either directly by passing the result to
the browser as a response to the request, or by redirecting the user back to the
main page after the route's functionality has been completed.


## Checking your work

### Running testcases locally

`npm run test` will run the test suite locally. Remember, as with any other
assignments in class, you should double check that your tests are passing in the
gradescope environment in addition to your local environment. "It works on my
machine" does not count as a valid excuse for failing tests in the autograder.

### Non-adversarial tests

The tests in this assignment were written in a very straightforward way. They
are meant to look like the type of test you might write for your own code to
ensure that it works correctly, NOT a very high confidence test that you have
actually coded everything up such that it works properly. For instance, it would
be very easy to write code that passes the tests but does not provide a
functional CRUD app showing the products from the database.

We reserve the right to investigate any submission to ensure that it is actually
showing the products from teh database rather than simply passing the tests by
injecting nonsense markup that passes the tests.

## Deploying your Application.

There are no points awarded for deploying your app to a live server, but it is a
good exercise to get familiar with the process. Hono can be deployed to Render
as a Node.js app - that is basically exactly what you've created here and the
most straightforward way to do so. However if you'd like some experience
deploying to a serverless provider, you can reconfigure [Hono to work on a
serverless app platform](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/web-standard) and
[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/tutorials) to use a serverless
database provider.

## Submitting your work

After you are confident that your code works, you can push the code to GitHub,
and then submit it via Gradescope. You can find the link to our class gradescope
in the sidebar. If you have issues with the autograder, please
contact us via Piazza ASAP. **Please keep in mind that technical issues while
submitting your assignment is not an acceptable excuse for improper or late
submissions.**
