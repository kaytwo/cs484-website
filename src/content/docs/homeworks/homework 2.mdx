**Release:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_release}  />

**Due:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />

## Quickstart

Create a new **private** repository under your own GitHub account
from [this template](https://github.com/swad-cs-uic/homework2-f25). Sharing your
code for the assignment, intentionally or unintentionally, is a violation of the
academic integrity policy in this course.

## Installing required packages

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and will create a folder `node_modules` where all these dependencies will be installed. `npm run dev` will run a local development server and open a web browser window for you that's pointed at your application.

## Skeleton code

The skeleton code of the application is designed to give you a better understanding on React and its features along with backend in Hono. The given project is 70% done, requiring some functionalities to be implemented in React application and in the worker/index.ts for server. You just need to add the logic as described in the TODOs. There may be a few TODOs missing, but they're easily detectable when debugging.

## Starting the project and navigating

Before running the project please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the step `Installing required packages`. Start the project by typing `npm run dev` in the terminal and open the URL in a browser.

If you just cloned the skeleton, the app won't work because some crucial code is missing.

To start navigating through the project, start with the `index.html` page and then follow the path to check how components are used. The main component used in this app is `App` (you can find the code for this in `App.tsx`). From here check the other components used, and how they're supposed to interact with the rest of the application. All the components are in `/src/react-app` folder.

Note: You should only need to change files in `/src` folder, specifically the `App.tsx` and the files in `/react-app/pages` folder. For the backend, you need to make changes in the src/worker/index.ts for the API to be fully functional and interact with the frontend.

## Deliverables

Your code must function identically to the fully functional application.

1. The homepage has **Expenses** table (Sr No., Description, Date, Cost, Actions) having 20 expenses per page. By default it’s sorted by **Date (newest first)**; users can switch to **Cost** and toggle sort direction via the chip next to each header.
2. The top navbar lets you navigate between **Expenses**, **Add Expense**, and **Total**.
3. Clicking **Add Expense** should open a form titled **“Add Expense”**. Submit a new expense with a description, a valid date, and cost adds the expense and returning to the homepage.
4. Each row supports **Edit** (inline, with Save/Cancel) and **Delete** (removes the expense; list updates accordingly).
5. Homepage should have pagination using **Prev/Next** buttons with an indicator **“Page X of Y”**. **Prev** and **Next** should be enabled/disabled according to the page.
6. The **Total** page displays the grand total of all non-deleted expenses, formatted as currency.

## Testing your code

`npm run test` will run the test suite locally. Remember, as with any other
assignments in class, you should double check that your tests are passing in the
gradescope environment in addition to your local environment. "It works on my
machine" does not count as a valid excuse for failing tests in the autograder. **Furthermore, for this homework the testsuite on Gradescope will be slightly different.**

| **Navigates between Expenses, Add Expense and Total from the navbar**                       | 10     |
| **Shows expenses by Date (newest first) as default, and toggles Cost ascending/descending** | 10     |
| **Split the expenses 20 per page; enable or disable Prev/Next buttons appropriately**       | 10     |
| **Creates a new expense and returns to the list**                                           | 10     |
| **Updates an existing expense, then deletes it**                                            | 10     |
| **Compute and display the correct total on Total Page**                                     | 10     |
| **Adding an expense: rejects invalid input**                                                | 10     |
| **Adding an expense: succeeds and returns the created row**                                 | 10     |
| **Getting expenses: returns only non-deleted items, sorted newest first**                   | 10     |
| **Updating an expense: updates the record and returns it**                                  | 10     |
| **Updating an expense: returns error 404 if the record doesn't exist**                      | 10     |
| **Deleting an expense: soft-deletes the record and returns success**                        | 10     |
