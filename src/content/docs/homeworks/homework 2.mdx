**Release:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_release}  />

**Due:** <DueDate relativeDate={frontmatter.relative_due} />

## Quickstart

Create a new **private** repository under your own GitHub account
from [this template](https://github.com/swad-cs-uic/homework2-f24). Sharing your
code for the assignment, intentionally or unintentionally, is a violation of the
academic integrity policy in this course.

## Installing required packages

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and will create a folder `node_modules` where all these dependencies will be installed. `npm run dev` will run a local development server and open a web browser window for you that's pointed at your application.

## Skeleton code

The skeleton code of the application is designed to give you a better understanding on React and its features. The given project is 70% done, requiring some functionalities to be implemented. You just need to add the logic as described in the TODOs. There may be a few TODOs missing, but they're easily detectable when debugging.
Don't worry about anything inside the backend folder, nothing is missing there.

## Starting the project and navigating

Before running the project please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the step `Installing required packages`. Start the project by typing `npm run dev` in the terminal and open the URL in a browser.

If you just cloned the skeleton, the app won't work because some crucial code is missing.

To start navigating through the project, start with the `index.html` page and then follow the path to check how components are used. The main component used in this app is `App` (you can find the code for this in `App.tsx`). From here check the other components used, and how they're supposed to interact with the rest of the application. All other components are in `/components` folder.

Note: You should only need to change files in `/frontend` folder, specifically the `App.tsx` and the files in `/frontend/components` folder. It can be useful to take a look at `backend/api.ts` to understand what parameters the API is expecting, but nothing is missing there.

## Deliverables

Your code must function identically to the fully functional application.

1. The homepage shows a page with a list of products from Costco. Each product has an image, a name and the ID.
2. You should be able to search products through the input box displayed.
3. Selecting the icon to the left (add), a form titled "Add New Product" should appear. Clicking "Add product" after entering **at least** the product name should add the new product to the list and the view should go back to the homepage.
4. Selecting the icon to the right (bin), a form titled "Delete Product" should appear. Clicking "Delete product" after entering the product ID should delete the product from the list and the view should go back to the homepage.
5. In the homepage, it should be possible to navigate through the pages using numbers displayed under the grid of elements. Note that the current page should have the class **active**.

## Testing your code

`npm run test` will run the test suite locally. Remember, as with any other
assignments in class, you should double check that your tests are passing in the
gradescope environment in addition to your local environment. "It works on my
machine" does not count as a valid excuse for failing tests in the autograder. **Furthermore, for this homework the testsuite on Gradescope will be slightly different.**
