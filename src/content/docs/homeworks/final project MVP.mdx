import { localizeTime, formatTime } from "../../../utils.ts";
import { Content as Deadlines } from "../../../components/Deadlines.md";

## {frontmatter.description}

**Due**: {formatTime(localizeTime(frontmatter.due))}

TLDR: submit [this form](https://forms.gle/zHZahbiG5Tk8Begg7) before the deadline.

For this deliverable, you're responsible for three core things:

* Describe the functionality that you planned to have implemented successfully for your MVP. If I need to I will go back to your checkpoint 2 turnin to confirm.
* Provide a link to your **deployed** app where I can test the functionality.
* Provide a link to your source repository/repositories where I can see the code.
* Provide any "test account" credentials I may need to access your app. Note that for the final deliverable, outside of specific 3rd party API restrictions (i.e. needing to add my google or spotify account to a list of approved testers), you can't use a test account - I will need to go through the entire app sign up / onboarding flow to test your app.

# Your deliverable is a deployed website

Rather than testing code, we will be testing a deployed website for this deliverable. This means that while you can continue to work on your app after the deadline, **we can perform our testing at any time, and if your app is in a broken state in production when we test it, you will get the points that that version of the site earns**. In other words, if you wish to continue working on your app after the deadline, you ABSOLUTELY MUST work on new features on a branch besides the main deployed branch (or you can submit a "mvp" branch deploy), and if you do want to push "improvements" to the version that I grade, make darn sure that you've tested it thoroughly before doing so.
