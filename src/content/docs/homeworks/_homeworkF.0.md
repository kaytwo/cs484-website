# Homework2.5 - Final project proposal

## Cloning your code repository (it's empty)

[This GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/XuE106N8) will allow you to create your group and accept the assignment. You will have an empty github repository to start with.

## Expectations

This deadline is purely for coming up with the main _idea_ of your application, not the technical architecture or implementation. Please write up (approximately one page of text should be sufficient) in your `README.md` in your repository answers to these questions:

- What does your application do?

- What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

- What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

## Due date

This assignment is due on Wednesday, October 26th, at 1:59PM. Most students have already been coming up with project ideas, this is your chance to set expectations for yourself and get started on the final project.

There will be no points provided for turning this in on time, HOWEVER leaving these design considerations to later on will seriously hamstring you in the final weeks of the semester, when we are working BOTH on the final project AND on the last two programming assignments. This is meant to be the fun part after all - I've already heard a lot of FANTASTIC project ideas and I'm excited to see them come to life.
