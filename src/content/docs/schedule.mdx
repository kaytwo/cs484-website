import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

All class meetings have a beginning of class quiz that starts promptly at 2 PM
unless otherwise indicated. The quiz will be about the topics listed on that
day's entry in the schedule.

All readings will be posted as soon as possible, and anything not posted 24
hours before class starts won't be on the quiz.

Any assignment marked <Badge text="Tentative" variant="tip" /> has not yet been
finalized - feel free to take a look, but this year's version may change.

All assignment turnins are through the course gradescope page. Readings marked
with 🧑‍🎓 are only required for graduate students; readings marked with 📵 will
not be covered on the quiz.
