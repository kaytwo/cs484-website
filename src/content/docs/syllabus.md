Web applications are simultaneously one of the most widely used and widely 
attacked forms of deployed code. At the same time, the concepts of computer 
security are best taught within a relatable context so that students can 
immediately apply their knowledge to relevant situations. The unique challenges 
inherent in building secure web applications made available to billions of 
potential users and attackers requires understanding how to use and integrate 
concepts from software engineering, systems programming, and computer security. 
This course integrates the concepts that underlie designing, deploying, 
attacking, and defending web applications to provide students with a 
foundational understanding of how to design and deploy scalable and secure web 
applications. 

This class will teach students the concepts and techniques that enable web 
applications to maintain high performance in the face of numerous users and 
attackers. Students will learn and be able to apply software engineering 
concepts to manage the complexity of client‐side and server‐side software. 
Students will learn and be able to apply computer systems concepts to manage 
the scalability of the web application, and provide performant service to large 
numbers of simultaneous users. Students will learn and be able to apply 
computer security concepts to designing a web application which is robust to 
known and unknown attacks. Students will gain familiarity and facility with 
modern tools which enable creating applications that apply the aforementioned 
design, performance, and security concepts. Students will learn and be able to 
apply fundamental security concepts so that they can evaluate the security of 
future application designs in the face of potential future attacks. 



## Prerequisites
While this course doesn’t require mastery of specific content from previous
courses, it does require the ability to pick up new programming concepts
quickly. Thus, CS 341 is a prerequisite, as JavaScript incorporates rather
esoteric concepts like closures, functional programming, and quite a bit of
event driven programming, and having seen these paradigms previously will be of
great help. Learning new languages and new programming paradigms are common
tasks in the life of a software engineer; learning how to apply your underlying
ability to decompose and systematize a task using a new language will implicitly
be part of your learning experience in this class.


## Course Announcements
Whenever possible, course information will be conveyed using this website.
Course discussion will happen via Piazza. Course assignments and assignment
grades will be collected and returned through Gradescope. We will use
iClicker cloud for in-class participation. You are responsible
for checking this website for the reading schedule and ensuring that you
complete all assignments, and keeping up to date on Piazza for any
corrections/clarifications regarding assignments or other important
information.

### Peer Instruction 
This course will be taught using [Peer Instruction][pi], a teaching model which
places stronger emphasis on classroom discussion and student interaction.

##  Homework late policy

Every assignment in this course is due at exactly the time stated on Gradescope, and while we will
grade late assignments, they earn zero credit.

Gradescope deadlines are *precise* - an assignment is late if it was turned in one millisecond or
one month late.

Gradescope deadlines are *universal* - you must turn in your code, and it doesn't matter whether you
didn't turn it in because it wasn't compiling, or couldn't upload it to git, or couldn't upload it
to gradescope. You can turn in homework assignments an unlimited number of times, so we recommend
that you turn them in early and often.

Because these deadlines are so rigid, by default we will not include your lowest
homework, and your three lowest discussion and quiz scores in your final grade for the class.
The later assignments and exams in the course are more difficult than the earlier ones, and there is
no exceptional late policy - we recommend that you do not use these unless you genuinely need to, so
that they're available if unexpected issues come up.

If your lowest homework, quiz, or participation grades are higher than your course average, we will
include them in the calculation of your final grade. This means that your lowest 
homework and quizzes can't *hurt* your final grade, they can only help it, so it will  always be worth it to
complete every assignment.


## Evaluation
Grades are curved based on an aggregate course score. There are separate curves
for graduate and undergraduate students. This means that the course score
cut-offs for an A, B, C etc. are not defined ahead of time: these will be set
after the end of the course.

The course grade weighting is:

| Task | % of total grade   |
| ---- | ----------------   |
| Beginning of Class Quizzes     | 10   |
| Class Participation | 10   |
| Homeworks           | 15  |
| Final Project (5 pt checkpoint + 10 pt final presentation)      | 15 | 
| Module exams            | 50  |

###  Reading Quizzes
Reading quizzes will be given at the beginning of each class period using
iClickers. Class participation credit will be given for answering a certain % of all questions asked each class period.
Every student will have their four lowest quizzes dropped, and class participation will be graded out of 25 total classes (which means you can miss 4 classes and still receive 100% of the participation grade).


###  Class Participation

Participation is an incredibly important facet of this course. The baseline
Class Participation grade will be based off of participating in classroom
discussion questions and answering questions via iClicker.  (iClicker questions
are graded for participation, not correctness.)  However, extra credit points
may be added for substantial contributions, entirely at the instructor's
discretion. Exceptional participation includes early reports of errors in
assignments, helpful discussion on Piazza, contribution of helpful code to the
common good of the class (e.g. test cases and/or testing scripts) and thoughtful
discussions during lecture.

While class participation is a very effective way to successfully learn the
material from this class, it is not a hard requirement. If you wish to forego
attending class on a regular basis, your in class quiz and participation score
will be computed as the higher of your final exam score and your achieved
in-class score.

### Overcoming challenges enables growth

This is not a lecture-oriented class or one in which mimicking prefabricated
examples will lead you to success. You will be expected to work actively to
construct your own understanding of the topics at hand, with the readily
available help of the instructor and your classmates. Many of the concepts you
learn and problems you work will be new to you and ask you to stretch your
thinking. You will experience frustration and failure before you experience
understanding. This is part of the normal learning process. Your viability as a
professional in the modern workforce depends on your ability to embrace this
learning process and make it work for you. You are supported on all sides by the
professor and your classmates. But no student is exempt from the process and the
hard work it entails.


## Mental health

We value your mental health and emotional wellness as part of the UIC student
experience. The UIC Counseling Center offers an array of services to provide
additional support throughout your time at UIC, including workshops, peer
support groups, counseling, self-help tools, and initial consultations to speak
to a mental health counselor about your concerns. Please visit the Counseling
Center website for more information (https://counseling.uic.edu/). Further, if
you think emotional concerns may be impacting your academic success, please
contact your faculty and academic advisers to create a plan to stay on track.



## Student Disabilities

If you have a disability that might impact your performance in this course or
otherwise requires special accommodation, please contact me as soon as possible
so that appropriate arrangements can be made. Support is available through the
[Disability Resource Center](https://drc.uic.edu/). You will need to
contact them to get your disability documented before accommodations can be
made.

## Religious observances

Students who wish to observe their religious holidays shall notify the faculty
member by the tenth day of the semester of the date when they will be absent
unless the religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day of the
semester. In such cases, the students shall notify the faculty member at least
five days in advance of the date when they will be absent. The faculty member
shall make every reasonable effort to honor the request, not penalize the
student for missing the class, and if an examination or project is due during
the absence, give the student an exam or assignment equivalent to the one
completed by those students in attendance. If the student feels aggrieved,
they may request remedy through the campus grievance procedure.

##  Academic Integrity

Consulting with your classmates on assignments is encouraged, except where
noted. However, turn-ins are individual, and copying code from your classmates
is considered plagiarism. For example, given the question "how did you do X?", a
great response would be "I used function Y, with W as the second argument. I
tried Z first, but it didn't work". An inappropriate response would be "here is
my code, look for yourself". **You should never look at someone else's code, or
show someone else your code.** Either of these actions are considered academic
dishonesty (cheating) and will be prosecuted as such.

To avoid suspicion of plagiarism, you must specify your sources together with
all turned-in materials. List classmates you discussed your homework with and
webpages from which you got inspiration. Plagiarism and cheating, as in copying
the work of others, paying others to do your work, etc, is obviously prohibited,
and will be reported.  We will be running MOSS, an automated plagiarism
detection tool, on all handins.

There are consequences to cheating on two levels - the consequences for your
grade, and the consequences at the university level.  Within class, the first
time cheating on a programming assignment or problem set will result in a 0 on
the assignment.  A second time on a programming assignment, or first time on an
exam will result in failing the class. Egregious cheating on a programming
assignment (including but not limited to purchasing a solution online) is also
grounds for failing the class.

Cheating on quizzes or exams are also grounds for failing the class. Please
don't do it. Quizzes are worth a tiny fraction of your full course grade - do
not put your hard work in jeopardy for a few tenths of a percent.

I report all suspected academic integrity violations to the dean of students.
If it is your first time, the dean of students allows you to informally resolve
the case - this means the student agrees that my description of what happened is
accurate, and the only repercussions on an institutional level are that it is
noted that this happened in your internal, UIC files (i.e. the dean of students
can see that this happened, but no professors or other people can, and it is not
in your transcript).  If this has happened before, in any of your classes, this
results in a formal hearing and the dean of students decides on the
institutional consequences.  After multiple instances of academic integrity
violations, students may be suspended or expelled.  For all cases, the student
has the option to go through a formal hearing if they believe that they did not
actually violate the academic integrity policy.  If the dean of students agrees
that they did not, then I revert their grade back to the original grade, and the
matter is resolved.
