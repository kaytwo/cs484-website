# Homework2 - CRUD in the Browser Using React


## Cloning your homework assignment

[This GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/3NWauEwD) will allow you to accept the assignment.


## Installing required packages

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and will create a folder `node_modules` where all these dependencies will be installed. `npm run dev` will run a local development server and open a web browser window for you that's pointed at your application.

## Skeleton code

The skeleton code for this application is an almost entirely complete, but completely "inert," version of the functional React application that the professor demonstrated in class. You job is to add interactivity and reactivity to this application.

## Deliverables

Your code must function identically to the fully functional application. There are no TODO lines in the code - part of the challenge of this assignment is choosing where and how to save state in your application.

A full list of deliverables will be added to this web page ASAP. Until then, refer to any notes you took from class about what is required for a complete functioning assignment.

## Testing your code

The TA will release integration based test cases for the assignment during the week it is due. As with other assignments, any reasonable-quality test cases that you provide to the class (integration or unit, take your pick) will be eligible for extra credit.

**IMPORTANT**: Test cases are not a list of TODOs. Many students had difficulty getting started on the previous assignment because they took the grading criteria / test cases as an ordered list of TODOs. Please take stock of the full application and requirements before you start writing your code; it will probably be worth your time to stand in front of a whiteboard and build an understanding of the application structure before choosing where to add what.

## Due date

This assignment is due on Friday, October 7th, at 1:59PM. A successful solution to this assignment requires you to write/change approximately **75** lines of code. You are highly encouraged to get started early, because Piazza responses will be delayed near the assignment deadline due to travel.
