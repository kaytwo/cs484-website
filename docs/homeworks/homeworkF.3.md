The final project will be graded similarly to the first checkpoint. I will be grading the final projects based on one the below things:
1. The "what does your application do" functionality described in the first (zero point) deliverable for the final project.
2. What I recall of the discussions we have had between then and now about what your project plan has evolved into.
3. A stickied post in your team discussion page that describes what your final project will do (you can get to it from [here](https://github.com/orgs/ckclassrooms/teams): once you are authenticated, click on your team).

If you would like yours graded according to #3 instead of #1 or #2, please make that stickied post ASAP. At some point during the holiday weekend I will go through and read them all and make sure that the deliverable seems appropriate for your group size. If you haven't substantially changed your plan from when the first deliverable was submitted, there will be no surprises here - if anything, I'm looking to make sure that what you are aiming for is achievable / reasonable and give some help on how to achieve that, not give you way more work/stress at the last minute. I just want things to be clear in terms of what the expectations are.

As with the MVP checkpoint, after the deadline I will use your app to determine whether it has the functionality you've described. I will start grading it ASAP, so please don't take time away from your other classes to continue working on it - in fact, unless you have very good CI/CD set up, it would be very risky to continue deploying new versions that you haven't tested, because you don't know when I will decide to grade it.

Like the MVP, you can submit a screencast with your assignment to show me how to use your app if I need to know how to do so. I won't grade that (I will only grade the app as it runs for me), but I will refer to it if I need to.

Importantly, I will only attempt to grade your assignment once, and you'll get the grade you get. The only reason I would re-grade it is if there was some outage beyond your control (which I can verify using any of the various status pages for the services you're using, like the [netlify status page](https://www.netlifystatus.com/) [vercel status page](https://www.vercel-status.com/) [supabase status page](https://status.supabase.com/) etc.
