# Homework F.1 - final project tech stack and MVP proposal

By 11:59 PM on Monday you must:

* Set up CI to host the built version of your team GH repository
   * Include a link to your deployed app in `README.md` so that I can take a look
* Include a diagram (in text or drawn or however you please) of your tech stack:
   * What services you will use to host (front end, back end, database)
   * What technologies you will use on the front end and back end
   * What APIs you will call out to
* Include a short textual description of what MVP (minimum viable product) you will be aiming to complete by the end of week 13.

This is worth zero points, but it's still important for you to hit these deadlines to keep moving forward toward your final project.
