# Final project GRADED deliverable 1 - deployed functional progress on final product

By 11:59 PM on Friday November 18th you must:

* Include a description of what your app currently does
* Include a link to the deployment of your app in `README.md` - this can be your main app URL, or a branch deploy.
* Optional but helpful - include a screencast that shows your current functionality in action. I should be able to run the app myself when I visit it though.


The entire final project is worth 20% of your grade. This deliverable is worth 5% - the final presentation will be worth 15%.
