All assignment turnins are through the course gradescope page.

If I find or mention additional useful videos & web resources I'll add them to
[this google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmsZ4vDPQCUrHuhLAyIv-PAJE33_wqFPKb1Rg646AnE/edit)
(UIC login required). Anyone can edit it so feel free to add resources you feel
are helpful. This carries over resources from previous semesters so the dates
probably won't match up.
